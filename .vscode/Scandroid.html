    <div  class="font_inf_white"><p class="paragraph"><span class="span_font_inf_white">Scandroid </span>is an American electronic music project created by Klayton, which previously included Varien in 2013. The project released its debut single, "Salvation Code", on August 6, 2013. Scandroid can be described as encompassing the retro synth melodies of the 1980s while still adapting to modern production, thus creating a new retro sound. Blending synth pop, industrial, and John Carpenter-style soundscapes, he developed the concept and made its recording debut with 2016's Scandroid.

    The Detroit-based artist created the character Red, who, according to the fictional origin story, discovered the "New Retro" sound of a "forgotten era" (i.e., the '80s) and formed the Scandroid project to resurrect that retro style. The Scandroid concept debuted in 2013, when Klayton and his then-collaborator, fellow synth artist Varien, released the debut single "Salvation Code." Scandroid's '80s-inspired electronic soundscapes recalled contemporaries like S U R V I V E and Lost Years, with nods to inspirations like Depeche Mode, Skinny Puppy, Tears for Fears, and New Order. A second single followed before Varien parted ways with Klayton in 2014 to focus on his own projects. Scandroid's first official full-length was issued in late 2016. The self-titled Scandroid featured an appearance by Circle of Dust, Klayton's '90s industrial metal band, on "Pro-bots and the Robophobes."

    <p>In 2017, Scandroid issued the remix collection Dreams of Neo-Tokyo, featuring interpretations by guests like Dance with the Dead, Waveshaper, and Gost. That same year, he released "The Force Theme," his neon interpretation of the Star Wars theme song, as well as "A Thousand Years." Both tracks landed on his sophomore set, Monochrome. Maintaining his pace, he released the EP The Darkness at the close of 2018, with its companion piece, The Light, arriving a year later. Klayton combined both EPs in 2020 for The Darkness and the Light.

        The aim of this project was to create music that consisted of elements from 1980's retro and electronic music with what the duo have described as a "Neo-Tokyo" theme. DJZ called the duos first song "Salvation Code" a "...retro synth-pop tune that harkens back to past visions of a cyberpunk future." and that it was a sci-fi narrative song.

        "...what Scandroid does well is bring a slightly different flair to the meat-and-potatoes synthwave sound that adds different enough musculature and flesh to the familiar skeleton..." – Simon Handmaker (of Heavy Blog is Heavy)
