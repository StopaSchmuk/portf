    <div  class="font_inf_white"><p class="paragraph"><span class="span_font_inf_white">Circle of Dust </span>is an industrial music project from New York City created by Klayton, who later became known as Celldweller. The project was active from 1988 to 1998 and then re-started in 2015 after Klayton gained back ownership of his old albums. The project has released five studio albums: Circle of Dust (1992), Brainchild (1994), a re-recording of Circle of Dust (1995), Disengage (1998), and Machines of Our Disgrace (2016).

    Circle Of Dust was popular in Christian circles during most of the 1990s, even though Klayton broke up the band in 1995. After their breakup, Klayton released one "last" album, Disengage. The liner notes to Disengage contained bits and pieces of an interview he had done, in which he explained that he had chosen to disband Circle Of Dust and start anew with a later project called Angeldust (which also featured Criss Angel), as well as various photographs hinting at feeling rejected by churches. Circle Of Dust was criticized by some Christians for not having religious enough lyrics, while other Christians criticized the music for being too chaotic.While there have been many other Christian bands involved in similar controversies, Circle Of Dust was often considered to be one of the most controversial.

    <p>Since the breakup of Circle Of Dust, there have been several re-releases of CoD albums. Among CoD fans, there are rumors that further re-releases of Klayton's material (including early CoD albums and his previous work on a project called Immortal) would be made. In 2005, Retroactive Records re-released the original self-titled Circle Of Dust album, Brainchild's Mindwarp, Argyle Park's Misguided, and Metamorphosis (remixes of Circle Of Dust, Brainchild, and Living Sacrifice).

        In November 2015, Klayton announced that he had obtained the rights to the entire Circle of Dust catalog, including the Metamorphosis compilation and Argyle Park side project, and decided to revive his Circle of Dust moniker, stating on YouTube, "I (...) decided to dive back into production as Circle of Dust for the new Celldweller album. I wanted to take what I'm doing now and reinterpret it in the way I used to produce. There is an official Circle of Dust remix of "Jericho" on End of an Empire. There's another track coming, brand-new, with Circle of Dust involved in the production, and it will be in your hands before the end of this year."
